    <h2>The whiskey sour is a simple but delicious cocktail 
        that is perfect for any occasion. It is refreshing, 
        tart, and boozy all at the same time. The egg white 
        adds a touch of richness and texture, but it is not 
        necessary.</h2>
    <p>The whiskey sour is a classic cocktail that has been around
        for centuries. It is made with whiskey, lemon juice, 
        sugar, and egg white (optional). The first known mention 
        of the whiskey sour was in 1862 in Jerry Thomas's
        "Bartender's Guide." However, it is likely that the drink
        was invented much earlier, perhaps by sailors who were
        looking for a way to combine whiskey with citrus fruits
        to prevent scurvy.</p>
